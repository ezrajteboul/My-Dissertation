	isbn = {978-0-85488-147-5 978-0-262-52464-3},
	abstract = {The desire to move viewers out of the role of passive observers and into the role of producers is one of the hallmarks of twentieth-century art. This tendency can be found in practices and projects ranging from El Lissitzky's exhibition designs to Allan Kaprow's happenings, from minimalist objects to installation art. More recently, this kind of participatory art has gone so far as to encourage and produce new social relationships. Guy Debord's celebrated argument that capitalism fragments the social bond has become the premise for much relational art seeking to challenge and provide alternatives to the discontents of contemporary life. This publication collects texts that place this artistic development in historical and theoretical context. - - Participation begins with writings that provide a theoretical framework for relational art, with essays by Umberto Eco, Bertolt Brecht, Roland Barthes, Peter Bürger, Jen-Luc Nancy, Edoaurd Glissant, and Félix Guattari, as well as the first translation into English of Jacques Rancière's influential "Problems and Transformations in Critical Art." The book also includes central writings by such artists as Lygia Clark and Hélio Oiticica, Joseph Beuys, Augusto Boal, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Thomas Hirschhorn, and Rirkrit Tiravanija. And it features recent critical and curatorial debates, with discussions by Lars Bang Larsen, Nicolas Bourriaud, Hal Foster, and Hans-Ulrich Obrist},

New design methods required for powering small, high-performance electronic devices are presented. Based on the authors' decades of experience, the book is filled with real-world solutions and many nomograms, and features simplified theory and mathematical analysis. This comprehensive volume explains common requirements for direct operation from the AC line supply and discusses design, theory, and practice. Engineering requirements of switchmode systems and recommendations for active power factor correction are included. This practical guide provides you with a working knowledge of the latest topologies along with step-by-step approaches to component decisions to achieve reliable and cost-effective power supply designs. Switchmode Power Supply Handbook, third edition covers: Functional requirements of direct off-line switchmode power supplies; Power components selection and transformer designs for converter circuits; Transformer, choke, and thermal design; Input filters, RFI control, snubber circuits, and auxiliary systems; Active power factor correction system design; Worked examples of would components; Examples of fully resonant and quasi-resonant systems; A resonant inverter fluorescent ballast; An example of high-power phase shift modulated system; A new MOSFET resonant inverter drive scheme; A single-control, wide-range wave oscillator"--},
